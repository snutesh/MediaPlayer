Music player using Java

This music player (mp3 player) is built using media class of java and JavaFx.

The files "playlist.txt" and "path.txt" stores the name of mp3 file and corresponding address respectively.

Till now no method has been added to remove multiple selections from list, so remove one by one or clear both the files to remove all songs from playlist.

To play the selected song just select the song name in list and click on play button.

No pause button is added, so you can not pause a song, you can add it if you want.

Seek slider, volume slider and duration of media is not added.

Moreover search field does not work, no code is added to it.

Also this is a netbeans project so if jar file doesn't work, copy all files to a folder and open it using netbeans, then buid and run it.

If you find any correction or improvements please let me know it.
